# Your frontend lives here

So, the current problem is that my website frontend is not updating
The steps in the video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYrBWmkfno, between 1hr 8min and 1hr 16 min capture the work that is required to update it.

However, im getting the following error. Its probably not a biggie
